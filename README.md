 A Roadmap To Be A Master Of Computer Science Powered by Peter.

## Prerequisites

>With the study of Computer Science, I gradually realise that it is indispensable to take some prerequisites when you wanna begin to learn/research a specific field. Thus I set up A CORNER to focus on doing these dirty jobs.

[**Prerequisites**](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/Peter_CS/blob/main/Prerequisites/README.md)

## Courses

 There are some foundamental courses(Core Courses) in Computer Science Major. The First is to master these courses and implement them.

 Course| Ratings | Info
 --:|--:|--:
Data Structure & Algorithms (C++) | &spades; &spades; &spades;  | [DSA](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/Peter_CS/blob/main/DataStructure/README.md)
Algorithms(JAVA) | &spades; &spades; &spades;  | [Algo](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/Peter_CS/tree/main/Algorithms)
Machine Learning(Python3)  | &spades; &spades;  | [ML](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/MachineLearning)
Deep Learning(Python3)  | &spades; &spades;  | [DL](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/DeepLearning)
Computer Architecture(Verilog) | &spades; &spades; &spades;  | [CA](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/ComputerArchitecture)
Computer Networking(Python/C++)  | &spades; &spades; &spades;  | [CNET](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/ComputerNetworking)
Operating System(C)  | &spades; &spades; &spades; | [OS](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/OperatingSystem)
Database(SQL/C++)  | &spades; &spades; &spades;  |  [DB](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/Database)
Compiler(C)  | &spades; &spades; &spades;  | [CP](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/Compiler)

## Projects
 The Coding is the most important for Undergraduate major in CS, So I wanna implement some Projects to exercise it.

## Extension
 As a student major in CS, I exactly understand the importance of Open Source and self-study.
 So It is necesssary for me to seek some excellent OCW courses and study it by myself.

 I would do this job in this Repo:
