# Peter's Computer Science

 A Roadmap To Be A Master Of Computer Science Powered by Peter.

## Courses

 There are some foundamental courses(Core Courses) in Computer Science Major. The First is to master these courses and implement them.

## Projects
 The Coding is the most important for Undergraduate major in CS, So I wanna implement some Projects to exercise it.

## Extension
 As a student major in CS, I exactly understand the importance of Open Source and self-study.
 So It is necesssary for me to seek some excellent OCW courses and study it by myself.

 I would do this job in this Repo:
