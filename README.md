 A Roadmap To Be A Master Of Computer Science Powered by Peter.

## Prerequisites

>With the study of Computer Science, I gradually realise that it is indispensable to take some prerequisites when you wanna begin to learn/research a specific field. Thus I set up A CORNER to focus on doing these dirty jobs.

## Courses

 There are some foundamental courses(Core Courses) in Computer Science Major. The First is to master these courses and implement them.

## Projects
 The Coding is the most important for Undergraduate major in CS, So I wanna implement some Projects to exercise it.

## Extension
 As a student major in CS, I exactly understand the importance of Open Source and self-study.
 So It is necesssary for me to seek some excellent OCW courses and study it by myself.

 I would do this job in this Repo:
