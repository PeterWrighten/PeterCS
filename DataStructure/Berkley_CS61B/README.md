## Lecture 1: Intro

**JAVA**

1. All code in Java must be part of a class.
2. We delimit the beginning and end of segments of code with {}
3. All statements in Java must end in a semi-colon.
4. For code to run we need public static void main(String[] args)
5. ```public static void main(String[] args)``` should be included in a public class. That also means it shoud be allowed only one public class in a .java file.
