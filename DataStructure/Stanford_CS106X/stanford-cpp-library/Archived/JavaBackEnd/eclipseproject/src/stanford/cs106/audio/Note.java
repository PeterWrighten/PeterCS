 *
 * @author Marty Stepp
 * @version Fri 2017/05/08
 * - added setPitch/Accidental(String)
 * @version Fri 2016/07/27
 * - bug fix for locale issues on nextDouble parsing
 * @version Fri 2016/05/21
 * - new constructors as per conversation with Alisha Adam;
 *   can now construct by passing just a String line
 * @version Fri 2014/05/23
 * - bug fix: Rests were storing octave 0, broke most octave up/down code
 * @version Fri 2014/05/08
 * - version for 15sp; folded into spl.jar
 * @version Tue 2014/05/27
 * - fixed minor bugs in setOctave/equals with rests based on autograder feedback
 * @version Sun 2014/05/25
 * - added stuff to facilitate autograder: equals, setRepeat,
 *   and changes to StdAudio interaction for better events
 * @version Sun 2014/05/14
 * - fixed issue with IllegalArgumentException on creating rests
 * 
 * Your program should work properly with an UNMODIFIED version of this file.
 * If you want to modify this file for testing or for fun, that is your choice,
 * but when we grade your program we will do so with the original unmodified
 * version of this file, so your code must still work properly with that code.

 * A Note encapsulates a pitch (A-G), a duration in seconds, an octave,

 * A song or melody can be thought of as a list or array of Note objects.
