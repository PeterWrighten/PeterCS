<h1 class=header><code>class LinkedHashSet&lt;<var>ValueType</var>&gt;</code></h1>

<p>
The <code>LinkedHashSet</code> class implements an efficient abstraction for storing sets of values.
A <code>LinkedHashSet</code> is the same as a <code>HashSet</code>, except that it exposes its values in the order they were inserted, rather than in the unpredictable order of a standard <code>HashSet</code>.
This is accomplished by storing the data in two ways internally: (1) in a hash table array, as in a <code>HashSet</code>; and (2) in a linear list, to remember the insertion order.
A <code>LinkedHashSet</code> provides identical lookup (<code>contains</code>) speed, nearly the same insertion (<code>add</code>) speed, and slower removal (<code>remove</code>) speed.
Its for-each loop and iterators emit the elements in the order they were added to the set, at the cost of the additional memory usage of the internal list.
</p>

<p>
	Since the members of <code>LinkedHashSet</code> are the same as those of <code>HashSet</code>, in the interest of avoiding redundancy, we refer you to <a href="HashSet-class.html">the <code>HashSet</code> documentation</a> for descriptions of each member.
