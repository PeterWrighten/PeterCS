<h1 class=header><code>class LinkedHashMap&lt;<var>KeyType</var>,&nbsp;<var>ValueType</var>&gt;</code></h1>

This class stores a set of <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> pairs.

A <code>LinkedHashMap</code> is the same as a <code>HashMap</code>, except that it exposes its key/value pairs in the order they were inserted, rather than in the unpredictable order of a standard <code>HashMap</code>.
This is accomplished by storing the data in two ways internally: (1) in a hash table array, as in a <code>HashMap</code>; and (2) in a linear list of keys, to remember the insertion order.
A <code>LinkedHashMap</code> provides identical lookup (<code>containsKey</code> / <code>get</code> / <code>operator []</code>) speed, nearly the same insertion (<code>add</code> / <code>put</code>) speed, and slower removal (<code>remove</code>) speed.
Its for-each loop and iterators emit the keys in the order they were added to the map, at the cost of the additional memory usage of the internal list.

<p>
	Since the members of <code>LinkedHashMap</code> are the same as those of <code>HashMap</code>, in the interest of avoiding redundancy, we refer you to <a href="HashMap-class.html">the <code>HashMap</code> documentation</a> for descriptions of each member.
	The only noteworthy difference in the documentation is that the <code>operator []</code> of a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> is currently read-only; it cannot be used for insertion.
	To insert into a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, use the <code>put</code> or <code>add</code> methods.
