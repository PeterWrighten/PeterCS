# Prime  

This collection of prime-related algorithms provides you with ways to solve these problems:  

1. Is it a prime?  
2. I need a primelist.  

Check this [euler_primelist_generating.cpp](euler_primelist_generating.cpp).

Check this [prime_validating.cpp](prime_validating.cpp).(Includes Miller_Rabin algorithm)
